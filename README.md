These are my WIP solutions to assignment one from [CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/): 
Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. 

[Video lectures here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC).

As an added exercise, I've taken to implementing the same assignments (that require raw numpy) in 
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
as well, e.g compare a linear softmax classifier notebook in 
 [numpy](https://github.com/krosaen/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/softmax.ipynb)
 and in 
 [tensorflow](https://github.com/krosaen/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1-tf/softmax.ipynb)
